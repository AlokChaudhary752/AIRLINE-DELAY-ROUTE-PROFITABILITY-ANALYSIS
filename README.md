# AIRLINE-DELAY-ROUTE-PROFITABILITY-ANALYSIS
Analyzed large-scale U.S. flight data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI to identify delay patterns, evaluate route performance, and estimate profitability using industry assumptions. Built interactive dashboards to support airline scheduling and cost optimization decisions.
# ✈️ Airline Delay & Route Profitability Analysis (USA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes large-scale airline operational data from the United States to identify
flight delay patterns and estimate route profitability. The goal is to provide data-driven
insights that can support airline scheduling, cost optimization, and operational efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze departure and arrival delay patterns
- Identify delay-prone airports and routes
- Estimate route-level profitability using industry assumptions
- Visualize insights using interactive dashboards

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
- Source: U.S. Department of Transportation (BTS)
- Data Type: Flight operations & delay records
- Records: Millions of domestic flight records

> Note: Profitability is estimated using industry-standard assumptions as airlines do not
publicly disclose route-level profit data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing
- **SQL** – Data aggregation and analysis
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and visualization

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed
- Average delay by airport, airline, and route
- Delay reason breakdown (weather, carrier, ATC)
- On-time performance ranking
- Route revenue and cost estimation
- Profit vs delay correlation analysis

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Hub airports experience higher congestion-related delays
- Weather is a major contributor to seasonal delays
- Some high-revenue routes become loss-making due to frequent delays
- Reducing average delay significantly improves route profitability

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Optimize scheduling at congested airports
- Improve aircraft turnaround planning
- Adjust pricing strategies on delay-prone routes
- Focus operational improvements on high-loss routes
